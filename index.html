<h1>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage.</h1>
<p1>In the short term I plan on making this webpage to store all of my assignments and build off of it, but in the long term I am hoping to gain more experience and make this into an actual portfolio that I can use on resume's.</p1>
        
<h1>Why did you select the site that you chose?</h1>
<p1>I selected this site because I always see videos talking about github and how informative it is, so I figured I should get the ball rolling as of now.</p1>

<h1>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage in your next step(s)</h1>
<p1>I plan on adding images and making the webpage more interactive and make it more user friendly and attractive to the eye.</p1>
