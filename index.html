                <h1>Describe how you plan to build upon your Webpage.</h1>
                <p1>In the short term, I plan on making this webpage to store all of my assignments and build off of it, but in the long term I am hoping to gain more experience and make this into an actual portfolio for a resume.</p1><hr>

                <h1>Why did you select the site that you chose?</h1>
                <p1>I selected this site because I always see videos talking about github and how informative it is, so I figured I should get the ball rolling as of now and it also reminds me of VS Code.</p1><hr>

                <h1>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage in your next steps</h1>
                <p1>I plan on adding images and making the webpage more interactive, user friendly, and attractive to the eye.</p1><hr>
