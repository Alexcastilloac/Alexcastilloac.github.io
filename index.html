                <blockquote><h2>Describe Yourself</h2></blockquote>
                <p>I always find it tough to describe myself because I already know who I am but when asked this question I completely space out. I'll start with the personal stuff first to get a better look into my life.I am married with one baby boy, officially 1 month old on the 14th of this month. The only hobbies I can think of is grilling, playing video games, and as horrible as it sounds, I love going to the mall and buying things I may or may not need! I am currently on the fence if I want to get out of the military or not, the base I am at isn't really the greatest and my wife doesn't like it here either. We just spoke today that if we get orders out of here that we will probably stay in longer.</p>
		<p>I want a career change and this class and experience will help me get to where I need to be. I have always wanted to build a website and wanted to see what goes into it and now I realize that I may need a lot more experience to get where I need to be. By the end of this class I want to be able to build a website that I can link to linkedin that shows my resume in an interactive way. I see a lot of place weighing more on experience rather than degrees so I need to do all the projects I can while this is fresh in my mind.</p><hr>

                <blockquote><h2>3 Hobbies</h2></blockquote>
                <p>I have found this new love of grilling once I moved into a house and was allowed to grill, I am finding myself always trying to grill something and find ways on how to grill better than I did.

		<p>My job in the Air Force is machining and welding, because of that I have developed a skill for CNC machining and always look up different ways to get better.

		<p>I feel like a hobby is something that you enjoy and you take time out of your day to do this thing. If I am explaining it like that then I feel like watching anime is also a hobby of mine that I enjoy.

                <blockquote><h2>Images</h2></blockquote>
                <p>Instead of pulling stock photos from the internet I am going to upload photos of myself that describe me a little better. </p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <ul><li>I want to add folders where you can access different information about myself if that is possible, the same way when you're on a website and you hover over a drop down menu and select a different tab.</li></ul>
