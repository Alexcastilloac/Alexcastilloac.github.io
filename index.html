                <h2>Describe how you plan to build upon your Webpage.</h2>
                <p>In the short term, I plan on making this webpage to store all of my assignments and build off of it, but in the long term I am hoping to gain more experience and make this into an actual portfolio for a resume.</p><hr>

                <h2>Why did you select the site that you chose?</h2>
                <p>I selected this site because I always see videos talking about github and how informative it is, so I figured I should get the ball rolling as of now and it also reminds me of VS Code.</p><hr>

                <h2>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage in your next steps</h2>
                <p>I plan on adding images and making the webpage more interactive, user friendly, and attractive to the eye.</p><hr>

                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <ul>bullet points</ul>
                <ul><li>To add points you want to use the tag "li" if you want it in a specific order and "ul" is not a specific order.</li></ul>
                <ol><li>Now if you want it to be numbered then you will start with "ol" and you can even start it on a specific number by putting "ol start="17""</li></ol><hr>

                <dl>
                        <dt>Now this is something you can use for Vocab words, put the practice in while studying.</dt>
                        <dd>So what you do for this is start with "dl" which means description list but that is your open tag, now you will put "dt" which will open another tag and this is something you can show on the website, then you will use "dd" for the explanation of the term you put in "dt".</dd>
                </dl>
