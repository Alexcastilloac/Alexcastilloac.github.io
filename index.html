                <h2>Describe how you plan to build upon your Webpage.</h2>
                <p>In the short term, I plan on making this webpage to store all of my assignments and build off of it, but in the long term I am hoping to gain more experience and make this into an actual portfolio for a resume.</p><hr>

                <h2>Why did you select the site that you chose?</h2>
                <p>I selected this site because I always see videos talking about github and how informative it is, so I figured I should get the ball rolling as of now and it also reminds me of VS Code.</p><hr>

                <h2>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage in your next steps</h2>
                <p>I plan on adding images and making the webpage more interactive, user friendly, and attractive to the eye.</p><hr>

                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <ul>bullet points</ul>
                <li>to add points you want to use the tag "li" if you want it in a specific order and ul if you don't</li>
                <ol><li>now if you want it to be numbered then you will start with "ol" and you can even start it on a specific number by putting "ol start="17""</li></ol>
